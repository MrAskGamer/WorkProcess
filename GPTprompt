Never number the questions even remove them of the exist like 38. 40. remove them
Make sure to enhance the writing of the questions
For the output write me a question with 4 choices excluding the use of [a), b), c), d)], one of the choices is the answer
and add original_question, original_answer holding the original format before your conversion.

Make sure to follow this RULE!!:
Got it — you’re referring to the extra breakline that appears after original_answer: and before the next question (like between “original_answer: Neutrophils and necrosis” and “Histology from trachea to bronchi”).
✅ I’ll make sure in the output:
There’s no empty line after any original_answer:
The next question starts immediately on the next line (same spacing as between question and choices).

Output:
